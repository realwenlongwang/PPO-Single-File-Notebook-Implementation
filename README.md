# PPO Single File Notebook Implementation
---
This implementation is a single file notebook PPO implementation. The implementation is based on the PPO implementation of [**OpenAI Spinning Up**](https://github.com/openai/spinningup/tree/master) and [**Stable-Baseline3**](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3). This implementation uses [*wandb*](https://wandb.ai/site) to log the performance. The performance is evaluated against **Stable-Baseline3** in Mujoco environments. The result can be view [here](https://api.wandb.ai/links/tcd-clearway/kh37ft8v).
